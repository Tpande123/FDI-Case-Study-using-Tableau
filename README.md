## Introduction: -

Performing analysis of FDI data of India from 2000 to 2017 using Tableau and answering some of the questions asked in this case study. The following steps are performed here ->

1.) Importing the Data in Tableau from the file - FDI Case Study.xlsx.

2.) Unpivoting data from converting wide format to long format.

3.) Cleaning Labels.

4.) Moving to sheet and story creation to visualize creation

5.) Answering the following questions? - 

    A. What are the top 10 sectors having highest value for FDI?
    
    B. What are the top 10 sectors having minimum value for FDI?
